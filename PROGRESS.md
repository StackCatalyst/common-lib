# Authentication Package Progress

## Completed Tasks
- JWT token management
- RBAC implementation with role hierarchy and permission management
- HTTP middleware with JWT authentication and RBAC authorization
- gRPC interceptors with JWT authentication and RBAC authorization
- Integration tests for HTTP middleware and gRPC interceptors
- Package documentation and usage examples
- Integration with core error handling framework

## Next Steps
- Add structured logging for authentication events (aligned with pkg/logging)
- Implement configuration management for token settings (aligned with pkg/config)
- Add metrics reporting for authentication operations
- Add rate limiting through cache management (using pkg/cache)

## Future Enhancements
- Support for external authentication providers
- Advanced monitoring and tracing integration
- Performance optimization and caching
- Security hardening and penetration testing

## Notes
- All core functionality is now implemented and tested
- Documentation is complete with examples and best practices
- Integration with other core libraries is the next priority
- Advanced features will be implemented in later phases
