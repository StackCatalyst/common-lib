# Common Library Progress

## Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure & Essential Libraries
### Week 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Error handling framework
- Structured logging
- Configuration management
- Basic authentication utilities

### Week 2: Database & Cache Utilities ✅
- Database abstraction with connection management
- Simple transaction handling
- Core query utilities
- Cache metrics
- In-memory cache implementation with TTL and size limits

## Sprint 2: Testing & Service Communication
### Week 1: Essential Testing Framework ✅
- Basic test utilities and helpers
- Mock implementations for common interfaces
- Test container support
  - PostgreSQL containers with configuration options
  - Redis containers
  - Kafka containers with broker and topic configuration
  - Localstack containers for AWS services

### Week 2: Service Communication ✅
- HTTP client framework with retries and circuit breaking
- gRPC framework with proper error handling and interceptors
