# Common Library Progress

## Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure & Essential Libraries
### Week 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Error handling framework
- Structured logging
- Configuration management
- Basic authentication utilities

### Week 2: Database & Cache Utilities ✅
- Database abstraction with connection management
- Simple transaction handling
- Core query utilities
- Cache metrics
- In-memory cache implementation with TTL and size limits

## Sprint 2: Testing & Service Communication
### Week 1: Essential Testing Framework
- ✅ Basic test utilities and helpers
- ✅ Mock implementations for common interfaces
- ✅ Test container support
  - PostgreSQL containers with configuration options
  - Redis containers
  - Kafka containers with broker and topic configuration
  - Localstack containers for AWS services

### Week 2: Service Communication
- ✅ HTTP client framework with retries and circuit breaking
- ✅ gRPC framework with proper error handling and interceptors
- ✅ Comprehensive examples and integration tests
  - Database operations (CRUD, transactions, batch operations)
  - gRPC service implementation with validation and metrics
  - HTTP client usage with retries and error handling
  - Cache operations with TTL and eviction
  - Configuration management with environment variables
  - Logging with structured fields and levels

## Next Steps
- Proceed with Sprint 3: Module Registry Service
  - Develop module storage system
  - Implement version control
  - Create testing framework
  - Build documentation generator

## Notes
- All core functionality for Sprints 1 and 2 is implemented and tested
- Comprehensive container support for integration testing is in place
- Examples directory provides both documentation and integration tests
- Documentation is complete and integrated with other libraries
