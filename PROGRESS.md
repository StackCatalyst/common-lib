# Common Library Progress

## Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure & Essential Libraries
### Week 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Error handling framework with advanced patterns
  - Basic error types and wrapping
  - Retryable errors
  - Error groups and context
  - Stack traces
- Structured logging with advanced features
  - Contextual logging
  - Log levels and sampling
  - Request tracing integration
- Configuration management
- Basic authentication utilities

### Week 2: Database & Cache Utilities ✅
- Database abstraction with connection management
- Simple transaction handling
- Core query utilities
- Cache metrics
- In-memory cache implementation with TTL and size limits

## Sprint 2: Testing & Service Communication
### Week 1: Essential Testing Framework ✅
- Basic test utilities and helpers
- Mock implementations for common interfaces
- Test container support
  - PostgreSQL containers with configuration options
  - Redis containers
  - Kafka containers with broker and topic configuration
  - Localstack containers for AWS services

### Week 2: Service Communication ✅
- HTTP client framework with retries and circuit breaking
- gRPC framework with proper error handling and interceptors
- Comprehensive examples and integration tests
  - Database operations (CRUD, transactions, batch operations)
  - gRPC service implementation with validation and metrics
  - HTTP client usage with retries and error handling
  - Cache operations with TTL and eviction
  - Configuration management with environment variables
  - Logging with structured fields and levels

## Current Priority (URGENT)
1. Complete Prometheus Integration ⏳
   - Finish metrics collection setup
   - Configure service discovery
   - Define standard metrics and labels
   - Set up recording and alerting rules

2. Distributed Tracing (Jaeger) ✅
   - Basic tracer setup
   - HTTP middleware
   - Context propagation
   - Comprehensive tests

## Future Enhancements (Post-Release)
1. Enhanced security features
2. Performance optimization utilities
3. Extended metrics collection
4. Additional monitoring integrations

## Notes
- All core infrastructure components are implemented ✅
- Core database and cache utilities are in place ✅
- Testing framework provides essential functionality ✅
- Service communication layer is operational ✅
- Example implementations are available for reference ✅
- Advanced monitoring integration in progress ⏳

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ All core utilities are thoroughly tested
2. ✅ Documentation is complete and clear
3. ✅ Example implementations cover common use cases
4. ✅ Integration tests verify all components
5. ⏳ Monitoring integration enables service observability

## Timeline Status
- Core functionality completed on schedule
- Currently implementing advanced monitoring (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Library is ready for initial service development with basic features
- Monitoring integration needed for production readiness
