# Authentication Package Progress

## Completed Tasks
- JWT token management
- RBAC implementation with role hierarchy and permission management
- HTTP middleware with JWT authentication and RBAC authorization
- gRPC interceptors with JWT authentication and RBAC authorization
- Integration tests for HTTP middleware and gRPC interceptors

## Next Steps
- Document authentication package usage and examples
- Add configuration options for token expiration and refresh policies
- Implement rate limiting for authentication requests
- Add metrics and monitoring for authentication operations

## Notes
- All core functionality is now implemented and tested
- Need to focus on documentation and configuration
- Consider adding support for external authentication providers
- Plan for monitoring and observability features
