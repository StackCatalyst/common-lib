TerraOrbis is a comprehensive platform designed to integrate advanced infrastructure as code (IaC) management features, policy enforcement, multi-cloud governance, cost optimization, and automation workflows. Below is a detailed requirements list to help you achieve this ambitious project, encompassing a wide array of essential functionalities.

### **Project Name: TerraOrbis**

### **Project Phases and Sections**
To manage complexity, we can break down the project into multiple phases, where each phase represents a self-contained project that can be integrated upon completion. Below are the suggested phases:

#### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Management**
   - **Support for Multiple IaC Tools**: Compatibility with Terraform, Terragrunt, Pulumi, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes YAML files.
   - **GitOps Integration**: Integrate with VCS like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
   - **State Management**: Remote state management with encryption and state locking.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline for IaC**: Integrated pipeline for build, plan, and deploy stages.
   - **Terraform Modules and Reusability**: Manage, version, and reuse Terraform modules with tagging and searching support.

#### **Phase 2: Environment Provisioning**
   - **Environment Abstraction**: Templated management of isolated environments (development, staging, production).
   - **Environment Variables Management**: Centralized secrets and variable management with integration with tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Ephemeral Environments**: Support for short-lived testing environments.

#### **Phase 3: Multi-Cloud Support and Orchestration**
   - **Cloud Provider Integration**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, VMware, and extendable to less common providers.
   - **Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Simultaneous deployments across multiple providers with a single-pane view.

#### **Phase 4: Cost Management and Optimization**
   - **Cost Estimation and Reporting**: Real-time cost estimation during planning stages with integrated dashboards.
   - **Cost Policies**: Budget and limit enforcement via policy-as-code.
   - **Cost Allocation and Chargeback**: Detailed cost breakdowns and allocation.

#### **Phase 5: Policy Enforcement and Compliance**
   - **Policy as Code**: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Sentinel for custom compliance policies.
   - **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval workflows for production deployments.
   - **Access Control**: RBAC integration with LDAP, Active Directory, or OAuth.
   - **Audit Trails and Logging**: Centralized logging with audit trail visualization.

#### **Phase 6: Automation and Self-Service Workflows**
   - **Self-Service Catalog**: Library of predefined infrastructure configurations.
   - **Automated Remediation**: Automated drift detection and remediation workflows.
   - **Scheduled Actions**: Scheduling of deployments and scaling actions.

#### **Phase 7: Monitoring, Alerting, and Incident Management**
   - **Resource Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus, Datadog, or CloudWatch.
   - **Deployment Monitoring**: Real-time deployment dashboards with detailed logs.
   - **Alert Management**: Integration with incident tools like PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Slack.

#### **Phase 8: Drift Detection and Management**
   - **Drift Detection**: Automated detection and corrective workflows for configuration drifts.
   - **Drift Visualization**: Visualization tools for tracking changes.

#### **Phase 9: Collaboration and Team Management**
   - **Team Structures and Projects**: Define team-based projects with isolated resources and configurable access controls.
   - **Notifications and Communication**: Integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email.
   - **Commenting System**: Allow commenting and documentation on environments and deployments.

#### **Phase 10: UI/UX and Developer Experience**
   - **Dashboard Overview**: Develop a dashboard showing essential metrics and system health.
   - **WYSIWYG Editor for IaC**: Provide an editor for IaC files with syntax highlighting and linting.
   - **CLI and API Access**: Develop a robust CLI and REST API for programmatic interaction.

#### **Phase 11: Security Features**
   - **Secret Management**: Integration with third-party secret management solutions.
   - **SSO and MFA**: Implement Single Sign-On and enforce MFA.
   - **Network Security**: Ability to define network policies, including VPC configurations.

#### **Phase 12: Scalability and Performance**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Platform scalability for enterprise-level workloads.
   - **Caching Mechanisms**: Caching for state lookups and resource deployments.
   - **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous task queues for large deployments.

#### **Phase 13: Analytics and Insights**
   - **Usage Insights**: Metrics on successful deployments, incident frequency, and user activity.
   - **Resource Utilization**: Cloud resource usage and optimization insights.
   - **Custom Reports**: Generate custom reports on cost, health, and compliance.

#### **Phase 14: Extensibility and Plugin Support**
   - **Custom Plugin System**: Develop a plugin framework for custom integrations.
   - **Marketplace for Modules and Extensions**: A marketplace for publishing reusable modules and plugins.

#### **Phase 15: Deployment Flexibility**
   - **Deployment Options**: SaaS and self-hosted deployment options.
   - **Containerized Deployment**: Kubernetes or Docker-based platform deployment for scalability.

### **Integration Plan**
Each phase should be approached as a standalone project, focusing on building a complete, functional unit that can be integrated with the other components. This approach ensures continuous progress, integration points testing, and early feedback to adapt and optimize further phases.

This phased breakdown allows you to iteratively develop and test functionalities while maintaining focus on delivering a fully integrated and comprehensive infrastructure management solution.
